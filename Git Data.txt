GIT:

==

Git is an indispensable part of modern software development. 
It is a version control system which can be thought of as an extremely powerful version of track changes 
in Your Project .

With git, 
1.you can collaborate with other developers, 
2.track all your work via commits,
3.revert to any previous version of your code even if you accidentally delete something important.






Installation & setup:
=================
1.Install Git On Windows.
Step3:
3.1Once installed, we need to do a one-time system setup to configure it 
by declaring the name and email address you want associated with all your Git commits.

3.2.Within the command line console type the following two lines. 
3.3.Open cmd prompt

c:\> 	git 	config --global user.name "Your Name"
c:\>  	git 	config --global user.email "yourname@email.com"

3.4.You can always change these configs later if you desire by retyping the same commands 
with a new name or email address.





Configuring ur project into git:
==========================
Step4:Open ur project folder after testing it
Step5:Open cmd prompt in ur project folder
Step6:
The first step is to initialize (or add) git to our repository.

Since this is our first commit, this list is all of our changes so far.

changes along with a message describing what has changed.
