Setting The Viewport:
==================
HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, 
through the <meta> tag.

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. 

It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

syntax:
-----------
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the
 page's dimensions and scaling.

The "width=device-width" part sets the width of the page to follow the 
screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The "initial-scale=1.0" part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
