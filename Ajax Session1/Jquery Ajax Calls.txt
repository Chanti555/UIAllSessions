Ajax:(Asynchronous Javascript And Xml)
===================================
Ajax is technology(Html,Css,Js) is used to 
	1.send request to server &
	2.receive response from sever 
at background.

Types of communication between Client & Server:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Synchronous communication
2.Asynchronous communication


1.Synchronous communication:
-------------------------------------------------
A synchronous request blocks the client until operation completes i.e. 
browser is unresponsive. 
In such case, javascript engine of the browser is blocked.

2.Asynchronous communication:
-----------------------------------------------
An asynchronous request doesnï¿½t block the client i.e. browser is responsive. 
At that time, user can perform another operations also. 
In such case, javascript engine of the browser is not blocked.



Ajax code is written by following tools
--------------------------------------------------------
1.Html		:	Dom preparation
2.Css		:	Applying styles to Dom (Optional)
3.JS/Jquery	:	1.Used to prepare code send client request to server & 
				receive response from client
				2.Dom manipulation
4.Text or HTML or XML or JSON :	Format of Data which is collected from Server



Software requirements:
====================
1.Web browser	:	send client request to server & receive response from client
	Ex:GC,MF,IE,...
2.Web server	:	accept request from client & send response to client
	Ex:Tomcat server,NodeJs server
3.IDE		:	preparing html,css,js/jquery code
	Ex:Eclipse(It must have JDK)

Order of software installation:
--------------------------------------------
1.Jdk installation		(Jdk1.8)
2.Eclipse  installation	(Eclipse oxygen)
3.Tomcat installation	(Tomcat 9)

In youtube type:	Java by chanti	(Session1,2,3)

Steps to write code in Eclipse:
-------------------------------
1.Open eclipse
2.New
3.Dynamic Project
4.Name=AjaxEx1
5.In target runtime->Click New Runtime->Select tomcat version->Browse tomcat intsalltion directory from
	C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0		location->finish
6.Next
7.Next
8.Check web.xml checkbox 
9.Finish
10.RightClick on project->new->html->name=index->finish
11.RightClick on WebContent folder->new->File->name=emp.txt->finish
  Type following data & save the file
	"This is Chanti Emp Data"

11.Install jquery
	copy jquery.js file & paste into WebContent folder in project directory then prepare following code
 in index.html page
	<head>
		<script src='jquery.js'></script>
	</head>
OR
	Copy CDN in script tag inside <head> tag.
12.Prepare jquery code to get emp.txt file data inside index.html page

13.To run the project
	RightClick on project->Run->Run as Server->Next->Finish

Jquery functions:
===============
1.load()	->Retriving/Getting data from server
2.get()		->Retriving/Getting data from server
3.put()		->Updating data within server
4.post()	->Inserting data within server
5.delete()	->Deleting data within server


HTTP status codes:
==================
1xx	: inforamative
2xx : success
3xx : redirection 
4xx	: client side error
5xx : server side error
