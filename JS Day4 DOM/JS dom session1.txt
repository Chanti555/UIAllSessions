Document Object Model Manipulation:
===================================
Step1:Understanding following 2 properties of each element.

1.value 	:This property can be taken in 2 approaches
	1.For <input> tag	
	2.For <select> & <teaxtarea> tag
2.innerHTML
	:This property can be taken for all elements except
	<input>,<select> & <teaxtarea> tags

Step2:DOM Manipulation

	1.Here we have to get element data through "value" or innerHTML
	2.Here we have to set element data through "value" or innerHTML
